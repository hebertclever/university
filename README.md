# LMS CRUD Dashboard

## Description

This LMS (Learning Management System) CRUD Dashboard is developed to manage users such as administrators, teachers, and students within an educational setting. Implemented using PHP, the system follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern. With this dashboard, administrators can easily create, read, update, and delete users, streamlining management operations.

## Features

- **User CRUD Operations**: Easily add, update, and delete users, including administrators, teachers, and students.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Provides an at-a-glance overview of user statistics and data.
- **User Search Functionality**: Allows for efficient filtering and display of users based on specific search criteria.

## To-Dos

- **Path to Delete Users**: There's a current issue where the relative path for the delete user action needs to be corrected.
- **Session Logic**: The logic handling user sessions remains to be fully implemented and optimized.
